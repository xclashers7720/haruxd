3.2.2 Looping Statement

While creating programming logic. we need to execute some statements repeatedly Iteration refers to the execution of statement or a group of statements of code for a fixed number of times or till the condition is satisfied. The condition should be boolean condition. Some commonly used JavaScript looping

statements are:

1. for.......loop

This loop executes statements as long as condition becomes true, control comes out from the loop when condition becomes false. Benefit of for-loop is that it combines initialization, condition and loop iteration (increment or decrement) in single statement.

Syntax:

break:

default: alert("Invalid day");

}
